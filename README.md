👋 Hi, I’m Yousef Seifi  
👀 I'm passionate about frontend development and eager to explore the world of artificial intelligence. I also enjoy working in teams and growing through collaboration.  
🌱 Currently, I'm learning HTML and CSS by building mini projects and managing my code with Git and GitHub.  
💬 Always curious and motivated to learn more about web technologies and real-world problem-solving.  
💞️ I’m open to collaborating on HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects, React apps, or beginner-friendly open-source contributions.
